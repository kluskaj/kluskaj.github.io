Hi, I am an FWO senior postdoctoral fellow working at KULeuven in Belgium.

My research aims at characterizing and understanding planet formation around young...and evolved stars.
As an observer I use several techniques to tackle this question and observe the disks of dust and gaz that form planets such as: infrared interferometry, radio interferometry, direct imaging (coronagraphy, polarisation) and spectroscopic times series.

I am an expert in the former technique, infrared interferometry, that provides very high angular resolution (of the order of a milliarcsecond which is the width of a hair as seen from 10km away).
As this technique does not recodr direct images I developped a way to reconstruct the image of the observed target called SPARCO.
